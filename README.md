# Harvest Profit Monte Carlo Simulator

This is a fairly simple Monte Carlo Simulator, based on an Excel version @nhorob67 had whipped up a while back.

This works on a similar principle, and runs directly in your browser. Which means... don't run too many iterations, or you'll freeze up your own computer. You've been warned.

## Development

To get a local copy of this repo up and running, run the following after cloning it:
```bash
yarn install
```

Now you can run a copy in development:
```bash
yarn start
```

And you are all set! I would recommend setting up `eslint` in your preferred text editor, if you intend on making changes.
