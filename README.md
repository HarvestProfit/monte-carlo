# Harvest Profit Monte Carlo Simulator

This is a fairly simple Monte Carlo Simulator, based on an Excel version @nhorob67 had whipped up a while back.

This works on a similar principle, and runs directly in your browser. Which means... don't run too many iterations, or you'll freeze up your own computer. You've been warned.
